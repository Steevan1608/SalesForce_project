## 📌 Overview
The **Airplane Management & Dispatch Workflow** project streamlines how airlines and operators manage aircraft-related requests in Salesforce.  
Instead of relying on manual spreadsheets and emails, this system centralizes:  

- ✈️ **Flight Dispatch Requests**  
- 🛠️ **Maintenance Work Orders**  
- 👨‍✈️ **Crew & Operational Requests**  

It provides:  
- Automated request capture with custom Salesforce objects  
- Single-level approval for initial verification  
- Real-time status tracking (Submitted → Approved → Rejected → In Progress → Completed)  
- Dashboards and reports to monitor requests by aircraft, type, and status  

**Outcome:** Faster approvals, reduced manual errors, improved safety compliance, and better operational visibility.

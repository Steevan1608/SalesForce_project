Project Title:
Aeroplane Management & Dispatch Workflow

Problem Context

An airline/operator receives a large number of aircraft-related requests every day â€” e.g., flight dispatch requests, maintenance work orders, and crew change requests. Currently the process is manual: requests are collected on paper or spreadsheets, verified by staff, routed through multiple teams (maintenance, dispatch, safety), and tracked via ad-hoc spreadsheets. This causes delays, missed requests, safety risks, and inconsistent operational decisions.

Business Problem

The operator needs an automated system to capture aircraft requests and work orders, track their status, and manage the initial dispatch/verification workflow to reduce human error and improve operational efficiency and safety.

Phase 1 Scope

Capture aircraft requests and work orders in Salesforce using custom objects.

Suggested custom objects: Aircraft Request, Aircraft, Crew, Maintenance Record (lightweight), Dispatch Log (optional).

Collect basic request details:

For dispatch/flight request: Aircraft Registration, Flight Number (or Request ID), Requesting Unit, Flight Type (scheduled/repositioning/test), Planned Departure/Arrival, Estimated Flight Hours, Required Crew.

For maintenance/repair request: Aircraft Registration, Issue Summary, Severity (A/B/C), Reported Hours, Requested By, Location.

Common applicant fields: Contact Person, Contact Info, Priority, Attachments (logbook excerpt, tech log, NOTAMS).

Implement single-level automated approval for initial verification (e.g., Dispatch Officer or Maintenance Officer approval):

Auto-route new requests to the relevant approver based on request type or aircraft base.

Approval outcomes: Approved (cleared for dispatch / proceed to maintenance scheduling), Rejected (requires resubmission), or More Info Required.

Optional: simple business rules (e.g., block dispatch if aircraft has open critical maintenance).

Generate basic status tracking for requests:

Suggested status values: Submitted, Verified, Approved/Cleared, Rejected, In Progress (for maintenance), Completed.

Provide a dashboard/report showing requests by aircraft type/registration and status:

Visuals: counts by status, by aircraft, by request type, and pending approvals.

Filterability by base, date range, and priority.

Expected Outcome:

Centralized tracking of all aircraft dispatch requests and maintenance work orders in Salesforce.

Reduced manual effort and fewer missed or lost requests during initial verification.

Faster decision-making for dispatch approvals and quicker turnaround for maintenance prioritization.

Improved operational visibility via reports and dashboards, enabling proactive resource allocation and safer operations.
